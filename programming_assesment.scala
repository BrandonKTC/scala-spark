// 1.) Check for Single Even:
// Write a function that takes in an integer and returns a Boolean indicating whether or not it is even. (See if you can write this in one line!)

// 2.) Check for Eve,s in a List:
// Write a function that returns True is there is an even number inside of a List, otherwise return False.

// 3.) Lucky Number Seven:
// Take in a list of integers and calculate their sum. However, sevens are lucky and they should be counted twice.

// 4.) Can you Balance?
// Given a non-empty list of integers, return true if there is a place to split the list so that the sum of the numbers on one side is equal to the sum of the numbers on the other side. For example, given the list (1, 5, 3, 3) would return true, you can split it in the middle, Another example (7,3,4) would return true 3+4=7. Remember you just need to return the boolean not the split index point.

// .5) Palindrome Check
// Given a String, return a boolean indicating wheteher or not it is a palindrom (Spelled the same forwards and backwards)
